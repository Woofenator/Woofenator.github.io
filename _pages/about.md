Hi! I'm a Senior Backend Developer with opinionsâ„¢ that he'd like to put out there on the internet and have scrutinized and torn apart (and his sanity questioned from time to time, preferably).

I mostly want to blog about topics that I've learnt over the years as I was climbing the seniority ladder, some coding adventures I've had over the years as well as some soft-skill topics from time to time.

So far, this site is mostly just a showcase of some things I've done recently and I'm proud of and an article or two. Knowing my track record, it'll probably stay like this, but who knows.

In any case, I'm but a man and my opinions are just that.

If you'd like, I have my Twitch and itch.io links at the top, as well as some socials in my author profile on the side
