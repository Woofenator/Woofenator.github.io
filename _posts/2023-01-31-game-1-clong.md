# Copying Pong

Pong was one the first video games ever created. Being one of the first, it is a simple game. All it takes to recreate it is just a ball, two paddles and some walls for the ball to bounce on. As such, it seems only fitting that this 20 games challenge begins with recreating this milestone of software and hardware engineering.

Deciding to tackle this challenge using the Godot game engine - an engine I had never used before - this was a chance to learn something new and refreshing in the game engine space.

- First exercise in challenge
- Made to get used to the engine
- Skipped best practices

## What is pong

- What pong
- Movement of ball
- Movement of paddle
- Interaction - ball -> paddle
- Interaction - ball -> wall
- Interaction - ball -> endzone

## The Paddles

- How they are constructed
- Movement handling
  
## The ðŸ…±all

- Approach I used
- Kinematic Controllers
- How it moves

## Interactions

### Ball -> Wall

- Kinematic Bodies do not handle collisions automatically
- Need to handle collision with walls in code
- {Code snippet}
- The simplest thing to handle
  
### Ball -> Endzone

- Second in terms of complexity
- Event driven architecture in Godot
- Reset the ball
- Increment score

### Ball -> Paddles

- Instead of overlapping, needs to bounce
- Probably not the most efficient method
- Vector Math
- {Code Snippet}
- Halving Y component -> normalising

## UI

- Used guide
- Separate Scene
- Not quite sure about the code
- {Snippet}
  
## Closing thoughts
