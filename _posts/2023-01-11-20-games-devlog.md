## 20 Games Challenge

Over the next few coming months, I have decided to undertake the [20 games or less challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io). It's an opportunity and a challenge to re-create classic video games in increasing levels of complexity to learn how to develop and design video games.

## What am I doing with it?

As a person that has a little bit of experience in creating video games, one would think I don`t have a need for this challenge, but to that I say the following: There is never a reason to not re-learn the basics for a particular skill set. So that's what I will do, go back to the basics and recreate some classic video games

## Why am I doing it?

## What do I hope to learn?
