    title: Yet Another Pong Clone
    excerpt: "Pong was one the earliest arcade video games ever created. Being one of the earliest, it is a simple game. All it takes to recreate it is just a ball, two paddles and some walls for the ball to bounce on. As such, it seems only fitting that this 20 games challenge begins with recreating this milestone of software and hardware engineering."

    excerpt: "Over the next few coming months, I have decided to undertake the [20 games or less challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io). It's an opportunity and a challenge to re-create classic video games in increasing levels of complexity to learn how to develop and design video games."
